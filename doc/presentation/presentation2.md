# Sprint Progress
   * This is what we had planned: 
   
        * Front-End: Ability to Drag/Drop a Tower, 
        PropertiesReader, General ObjectView, Shop
        
        * Data Configuration: File Checking Mechanism, 
        ConfigurationReader
        
        * Back-End: Create the Driver, GridPath, 
        LandCell Abstract, Moving Balloons, Grid
        
        * Controller: set up general communication for 
        the game to work
        
   * Not able to complete target movement 
    * Estimate was optimistic
    * Communicated consistently about design, writing tests,
    and refactoring

# Significant Event Within Sprint
   * Altered data files to resemble the path and have dimensions
   of the grid
   * Originally, had data formatted as an actual grid of 0s and path
   * More effective to have data file from which we can directly extract path
   * Allows for more flexibility as well

# Teamwork and Communication
   * Productive Pair Programming! 
   
        * Remote Control on Zoom 
        
        * Allows for constant collaboration
        
   * Potential Improvement: Spread tasks out
   
        * Avoid working in large chunks of time
