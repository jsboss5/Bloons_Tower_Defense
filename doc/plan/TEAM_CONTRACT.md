# JAJA team contract

### As a project team, we promise to:
* Take into account eachother's circumnstances when it comes to expectations
* communicate with the team regularly and respond promptly to the group chat
* Discuss high level design as a team 
* Set reasonable deliverables for each week
* We promise to help others if they need help on something - not other project teams though they are on their own
* We will be accountable for writing tests after every feature, because if not we will be in a bad position. 
* Make sure to implement features with good design principles in mind. Don't move on until the design for a feature is good and a test is written. 

### If someone on our team breaks one or more of these promises, the team may:
* Have to get a tattoo of jaja (jk ... ?)
* Have an intervention (we are friends so it's a respect thing)
* If this offense occurs three or more times, they have will be in charge of writing all of the javadoc comments and the test class. 


### Team Procedures:
 * High level design meetings 
 * Zoom meetings, text group chat to discuss problems and questions (Status updates)
 * Having zoom meetings after TA meetings -> we can meet Thursday nights 
 * Lots of commits - TODOS are great
 * meet over zoom whenever there is confusion with merge conflicts
